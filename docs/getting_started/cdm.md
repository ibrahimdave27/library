## What is CDM?
CDM (Collaborative Decision Making), manages demand and capacity across the network by coordinating departure slots, regulating outbound flow rates, and adjusting traffic patterns to prevent sector or airport overload. By providing a structured approach to traffic sequencing and delay management, CDM ensures smoother operations and more consistent handling during high-traffic conditions and major events.

### Activating CDM
1. The plugin is split into 2 roles, "master" and "slave". The "master" should be the lowest ATC position, usually delivery.

    When CDM is in use, an aerodrome should always have master, **however only 1 master per aerodrome is permitted**. Controllers may be the master at 2 airports if covering topdown, simply use the command below.

    `.cdm master {airport}` should be used to become the master of the selected aerodrome.

2. Using the CDM Master Panel, click on the aerodrome that you are opening (if you are controlling TMA and above, you are able to click multiple aerodromes) and wait until the aerodrome turns green. This indicates that this aerodrome is active with CDM.

### Controller Change

During a controller handover, the current master (old controller) will change to a slave using `.cdm slave {airport}`, the new controller will then use the `.cdm master {airport}` command to become the new master. Once the new master has done this, the new controller will also need to run the `.cdm resetmaster {airport}` command.

## Commands

| Command                                            | Description                                                                                 |

## Usage

### Delivery (DEL)

When CDM is in use, pilot's should call for clearance as normal, however DEL should inform the pilot of their TSAT.

!!! info "Phraseology"

    UAE101, readback correct, QNH 1001 information A is current, TSAT 1203


When the pilot calls for start, the master should left click the TOBT column to generate timings (if not already there).
If the TSAT of the aircraft is ±5 minutes, shown in a ![Dark Green](<img/dark green.svg>) `DARK GREEN` colour, then the aircraft should be handed off to GMC.

!!! info "Phraseology"

    UAE101, hold position, contact ground 118.350

If the aircraft calls prior to the ±5 minute window, shown in a ![Light Green](<img/light green.svg>) `LIGHT GREEN` colour, then the aircraft should be told to hold position and a TSAT should be passed on.

!!! info "Phraseology"

    UAE101, TSAT 1203, hold position

!!! warning

    When handing off from DEL to GMC, DEL should set the status of the aircraft to "FREQ".


**Missed Slot**

If the aircraft is not marked with "FREQ" before TSAT +6, CDM will determine the aircraft as suspended shown by ![SUSP](img/SUSP.svg) `SUSP` in the NET column. When the aircraft calls ready for start the process is to be as normal where we left click the TOBT column to regenerate timings (as shown above).


### Ground Movement Control (GMC)

When an aircraft calls for start, GMC should confirm that the TSAT is within ±5 minutes, shown ![Dark Green](<img/dark green.svg>) `DARK GREEN` colour, before giving push and start.


### Tower (AIR)

The AIR controller should make use of the TTOT/CTOT timings to determine the departure order of aircraft.


## Pilot Submitted TOBT

Pilots are able to submit their own slot (TOBT) time through [vats.im/vdgs](https://vats.im/vdgs). Through this system, pilots are able to manually input their TOBT and view their TTOT/CTOT among other information.

## Frequently Asked Questions
??? Question "What is the difference between TOBT and TSAT?"
     TOBT is the time the pilot would like to push without delays or traffic taken into consideration. TSAT includes all of this, the time the pilot would like to push added with delays, SID intervals as well as traffic around the Gulf.

??? Question "Does white mean they have pushed on time?"
     If there TOBT/TSAT is showing white, it just means that they have pushed regardless of whether it was on time or not.

??? Question "Do pilots NEED to submit their TOBT via the link?"
     No. If traffic at the aerodrome is light and it won’t cause any delays, you can manage this manually. When the pilot requests pushback, simply follow standard procedures, left-click the TOBT column to input their timings, and approve the pushback.
